# Secret Variables

While storing the Task configurations in Git is powerful, it's biggest gap is that it's a terrible place to store configurations you wish to keep secret. This could include things such as:

* Cloud Account Credentials
* Username/Passwords
* SSH Keys

To resolve this, Airflow lets you [define variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/variable.html) in the UI/CLI and pulled through the Airflow SDK. 



# Sailplane Vault

For users leveraging the `playground` or `tenant` mode of installation benefit from the fact that Airflow instances created with those modes are auto-wired to connect to our [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance. This ensures Airflow will work OOTB as our Vault has all of the required variables defined in it. 

## Variables for specific tasks

It's possible to set variables for a specific dag/task tuple, by default Airflow will try to fetch a secret with the name `<DAG_NAME>-<TASK_NAME>` from a connected vault instance. The variables set in this secret will take precedence to any other variable defined in the task.

Example `4.11-aws-sdn-data-plane-router` variable:

```json
{
    "TERMINATIONS": "mix"
}
```


# Supported Variables

Currently the code pulls the following variables. Our Vault also has default values for them.
